Getting Started
Prerequisites

To start working with this template, you will need:

    A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom)
    Basic knowledge of HTML

To set up the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    Open the index.html file in your preferred text editor.

Folder Structure

The project follows a simple folder structure:

    index.html: The main HTML file for the product page.
    css/: A folder containing CSS files for styling.
    js/: A folder containing JavaScript files for interactivity.
    images/: A folder containing image assets.

HTML Best Practices

    Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and readability.
    Include a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning of the HTML file.
    Use the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag to ensure proper character encoding.
    Include a <title> tag for the page title.
    Use the <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> tags to create a clear document structure.
    Use the <figure> and <figcaption> tags for images and their descriptions.
    Use the <button> tag for clickable elements instead of <a> when not linking to another page.
    Use ARIA roles (e.g., role="button") for improved accessibility.
